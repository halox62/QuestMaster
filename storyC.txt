**Prerequisites:**  
The adventurer has just arrived alone on the island shore, carrying a backpack, an old map, and a compass. He has not yet ventured inland or encountered any natives or dangers. The island’s geography is clear in your mind: you stand at the *shore* location, with the *jungle edge* just ahead. Beyond the jungle lies the *collapsed cave*, rumored to hold a sacred obsidian medallion. Further inland are the *village* and the ancient *temple*, home to an altar puzzle guarding the island’s treasure. You are aware that venomous traps lurk near the cave and temple, and that a native ally may be encountered along the way.

**Narrative Description:**  
The salty breeze brushes against your face as you stand on the sun-drenched shore of the mysterious island. Palm trees sway gently behind you, and the dense jungle looms ahead, a wall of green mystery and whispered secrets. Your grandfather’s old map, worn and faded, flutters in your hand, revealing only a partial path inland. The compass needle quivers uncertainly, as if sensing the island’s hidden dangers. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming orchids, but beneath the beauty lies an undercurrent of menace. Somewhere deep within the jungle, a sacred obsidian medallion waits, the key to unlocking the island’s ancient treasure. You know the journey will be perilous—venomous traps near the cave and temple, hostile natives, and confusing trails lie ahead. Yet, the promise of discovery and the legacy of your grandfather’s quest push you forward. The jungle edge beckons, a threshold between the known and the unknown.

**Choices:**  
→ *Venture directly into the jungle edge via the main trail*: (updates at_shore: false, at_jungle_edge: true) [go to 2]  
→ *Scout the shoreline for a safer, less obvious path inland*: (updates at_shore: false, at_jungle_edge: true, wounded: false) [go to 3]

**Prerequisites:**  
The adventurer has left the shore and arrived at the jungle edge by taking the main trail, ready to explore deeper. You know a venomous trap is hidden near the collapsed cave ahead.

**Narrative Description:**  
The jungle edge greets you with a cacophony of life—chirping birds, rustling leaves, and distant howls. The path ahead is narrow and tangled, vines hanging like serpents ready to strike. The air grows humid, thick with the scent of moss and decaying wood. You notice faint footprints and broken branches, signs that others have passed this way, but whether friend or foe remains unknown. The map offers little guidance here, and the dense canopy filters the sunlight into eerie patterns. Somewhere beyond lies the collapsed cave rumored to hold the sacred medallion. Your heart pounds with anticipation and caution. Every step could trigger a hidden trap or draw the attention of the island’s wary natives. The jungle is alive, watching, waiting.

**Choices:**

**Prerequisites:**  
The adventurer has scouted the shoreline and found a less obvious path inland, arriving safely at the jungle edge without injury.

**Narrative Description:**  
You skirt the shoreline, eyes peeled for hidden dangers and alternative routes. The salty tang of the sea fades as the dense jungle encroaches, its shadows deep and inviting. You find a narrow, less traveled trail veiled by thick ferns and hanging moss. The ground is soft beneath your boots, muffling your steps. The air hums with the buzz of insects and the distant call of exotic birds. This path feels safer, less likely to harbor traps, but it is longer and more winding. The map offers no clues here, but your instincts tell you this route might avoid the worst dangers. Still, the jungle’s secrets are many, and the unknown waits just beyond the next bend.
