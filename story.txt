**Prerequisites:**  
The adventurer has just arrived alone on the island shore, carrying a backpack, an old map, and a compass. The dense jungle looms ahead, its edge visible beyond the sandy beach. The path inland is uncertain, and the air is thick with humidity and the scent of salt and earth.  

**Narrative Description:**  
The sun beats down mercilessly as you stand on the sandy shore, waves gently lapping at your boots. The island’s dense jungle stretches before you, a wall of green shadows and tangled vines. Your grandfather’s old map flutters in the breeze, its faded lines hinting at secrets hidden deep within. The air is alive with the calls of distant birds and the rustle of unseen creatures. You know the first step is to reach the jungle edge, where the real journey begins. The path ahead is fraught with danger—venomous snakes, hidden traps, and the watchful eyes of the island’s natives. Yet, the promise of the sacred medallion and the treasure beyond drives you forward. You can choose to take the direct path through the dense undergrowth, risking hidden dangers, or follow the safer, winding coastal trail that may take longer but offers a chance to prepare.  

**Choices:**  
→ *Take the direct jungle path*: Move inland quickly but risk traps and injury (updates at_shore: false, at_jungle_edge: true, wounded: possibly false) [go to 2]  
→ *Follow the coastal trail*: Take a longer, safer route to the jungle edge, allowing time to observe surroundings (updates at_shore: false, at_jungle_edge: true, wounded: false) [go to 3]

**Prerequisites:**  
The adventurer has chosen the risky direct jungle path and reached the jungle edge but suffered a minor injury from a hidden trap.  

**Narrative Description:**  
Thorns scrape your arms and the ground beneath your feet is uneven and slick with moss. Suddenly, a sharp sting in your leg causes you to stumble—an unseen trap has caught you off guard. You manage to free yourself, but a burning pain reminds you of the jungle’s dangers. The dense foliage parts ahead, revealing the shadowy outline of the collapsed cave rumored to hold the sacred medallion. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decay. You can press on despite your wound, risking further harm, or retreat to the coastal trail to tend your injury and seek safer passage. The jungle seems to whisper warnings, but the treasure calls louder.
